## What Are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a platform that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows directly within your GitHub repository. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code, or create custom workflows for virtually any task, all triggered by events in your repository.

## Setting Up a Basic Workflow

To get started, create a workflow file in your repository under the `.github/workflows/` directory. Workflow files are written in YAML and define the automation process.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple workflow file:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run a script
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
```

- **`.github/workflows/`**: The directory where all workflow files reside.
- **`name`**: The name of your workflow.
- **`on`**: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.
- **`jobs`**: Defines the tasks to execute.

## Workflow Syntax

A workflow file consists of several key components:

- **`name`**: Optional name of the workflow.
- **`on`**: Events that trigger the workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
- **`jobs`**: A collection of jobs to run.
  - **`runs-on`**: The environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`).
  - **`steps`**: Individual tasks within a job.
    - **`uses`**: References an action from the marketplace or a local path.
    - **`run`**: Executes a shell command.

## Triggering Workflows

Workflows can be triggered by various GitHub events, such as:

- **`push`**: When code is pushed to a branch.
- **`pull_request`**: When a pull request is created or updated.
- **`schedule`**: Using cron syntax (e.g., `0 0 * * *` for daily runs).
- **`workflow_dispatch`**: Manually triggered via the GitHub UI.

Example of a scheduled workflow:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
```

## Common Use Cases

GitHub Actions can automate a variety of tasks:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Build and test code on every push.
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install
         - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
   ```

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
   - Deploy to a server after tests pass.
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Deploy to server
           run: ssh user@server "cd /app && git pull"
   ```

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Run linters or security checks.
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     lint:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Run linter
           run: npm run lint
   ```

## Security and Permissions

Security is critical in workflows:

- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in repository secrets.
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Use secret
      run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  ```

- **Permissions**: Define what a workflow can do.
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    issues: write
  ```

## GitHub Actions Marketplace

The [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) offers pre-built actions to simplify workflows. For example, use `actions/setup-node@v3` to set up a Node.js environment.

## Monitoring and Debugging

Monitor workflows via the "Actions" tab in your repository. Check logs for each step to debug issues. Use `echo "DEBUG_INFO" >> $GITHUB_ENV` to log custom variables.

## Matrix Builds

Test across multiple environments using a matrix strategy:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm test
```

## Artifacts and Caching

- **Artifacts**: Store files generated by workflows.
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: ./build/
  ```

- **Caching**: Speed up workflows by caching dependencies.
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```

## Composite Actions and Reusable Workflows

- **Composite Actions**: Bundle steps into a reusable action.
- **Reusable Workflows**: Call a workflow from another workflow.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    call-workflow:
      uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
  ```

## Integrations

Integrate with tools like Slack, AWS, or Docker by using actions or custom steps.

## Troubleshooting

- **Job fails**: Check logs for errors.
- **Workflow not triggering**: Verify the `on` event syntax.
- **Permissions issues**: Ensure correct permissions are set.
